About:
These textures are for use with the Quake3 Arena engine, including IoQuake3, and any mods. They are designed to replace the standard Baseq3 textures that shipped with Quake3.  To use them, simply place the pk3 in your baseq3 folder and enjoy.  Servers must have this pk3 file if you wish to avoid being
kicked for Sv_pure 1.  

98% of the textures are higher resolution than the originals, so for example a 256x256 texture is now 512x512. This does not change the size they appear on pre-compiled maps.  If you are using them to create New maps, then you are advised to 1/4 scale the textures to match the original size, as most of the original maps use a 0.5 scaling on the texture. So you would set your width height to 0.25 to get the best scaling.  Some textures just did not warrant being higher res because they would be massive in size. Not all textures are exact replicas of the original, simply because I do not have the skill to recreate some of the fantastic original artwork.  However, I hope I have done some justice where needed. 

I originally created these textures so that I could distribute XCSV as a standalone game and still include the Baseq3 textures.  This means that any 3rd party maps that use Baseq3 textures will not have missing textures.  

Thanks:
To Maria, Shoxy and Festy for being supportive throughout the process!
